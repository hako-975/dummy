1. Open task manager to kill Elan Service (2x), ETD Control Center, ETD Control Center Helper and ETDTouch.
 
2. Used regedit to set Tap_Two_Finger_ShowItem, Tap_Two_Finger, Tap_Two_Finger_Enable to 1 (located in HKEY_Current_User\Software\Elantech\Smartpad)
	Tap_Two_Finger_Enable = 1
	Tap_Two_Finger = 1
3. Restart, login with account & 2 finger tap now works as right click.

4. Remove admin rights if required

Open regedit, go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER -> SOFTWARE -> Elantech -> Smartpad, change ScrollControl_Mode from 0 to 1
